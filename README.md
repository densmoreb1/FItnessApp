# Fitness App

This is a project for me to learn Flutter, working with variables, funcitons, and database.

## Description

This app was designed by me. Turns out, I am not good at design. I understand the code and I am able to code a design. The main page of the app shows recent workouts and the second page shows a card that is your upcoming workout. You can tap on the card and input the things that you did.
